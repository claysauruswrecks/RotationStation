# VectorBoss

Where the spin vectors go to align.

THE BADDEST DATA HUSTLER IN THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING HOOD

VectorBoss is all about embedding that sweet, sweet open-source AST tree-space straight outta Compton and into a straight up high-dimensional vector encoding.

The illest data juggernaut. This street-smart component ingests and vectorizes all kinds of data so you can sip on that gin and juice instead of sweatin' on those tech docs all day.

It's the ghetto blaster of natural-language knowledge querying.
