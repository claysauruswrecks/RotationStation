THE BADDEST DATA HUSTLER IN THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING HOOD

VectorBoss is about embedding dat AST space into a straight thuggin' high-dimensional vector encoding.

The illest data juggernaut. This street-smart component ingests and vectorates the data so you can sip on that sizzurp instead of sweatin' on those tech docs all day.

It's the ghetto blaster of semantic synthesis, automatic no-slip zone.
